Dear Prospective Partner,

This is a Management Placement on behalf of Mr. Hosni Mubarak. My name is Mr David Wei and I am a top management executive here at the Bank
of China, United Kingdom. Our bank website is www.boc.cn

My friend Mr. Hosni Mubarak has presented a subtle offer which will need the help of a partner like you to complete successfully. Mr.
Hosni Mubarak is in a difficult situation and he must immediately relocate certain sums of money out of Bank of China in Beijing, China.
More so, this must be done in such a way that it must not be tied to Mr. Mubarak. The sum is currently deposited in the name of an existing
legal entity. Your role will be to:

[1]. Act as the original beneficiary of the funds.
[2]. Receive the funds into a business/private bank account.
[3]. Invest and Manage the funds outside of Egypt.
[4]. Value of funds: $45 Million US Dollars.

Everything will be done legally to ensure the rights to the funds are transferred to you. If you agree to partner with Mr. Mubarak, he will
compensate you with 20% of the total sum for your role as the beneficiary partner to the funds. Should you prefer I re-contact you
with more express facts, you can send me your:

[1] Full Names:
[2] Personal Profile:
